# Housing Prices in DKI Jakarta
Bank Indonesia predicts that house prices will go up in the end of year 2022 (https://katadata.co.id/agustiyanti/finansial/62848294c7b6c/bi-ramal-harga-rumah-naik-terbatas-pada-kuartal-ii-2022). Due to that prediction, I am interested to see the housing prices currently in the capital city of Indonesia, DKI Jakarta. 

I used Python to do data scraping of real estate website, LaMudi.co.id. I only did a filter on the city since I am aiming to know the price of all type of housing in DKI Jakarta. Then, I used Tableau to do data analysis based on the data I have gotten from LaMudi.co.id.

From analyzing, there are few things I noticed:
1. The lowest price is 150,000,000 or 150 million idr, with DKI Jakarta's minimum wage per month of 4.641.854 idr it would take at 32.31 months worth of income to buy the cheapest price in Jakarta. 
2. The average of the housing prices that is currently on sale is 6,139,225,000.00 or approx 6 billion idr. It would take 1322 months worth of minimum wage income to buy. 
3. Building area are scattered more evenly than the land area. The biggest land area is 10k while biggest building area is 2.8k.
4. Commonly, the higher the price the bigger the area. 
5. With the average of housing price on 6,139,225,000.00 idr, average of building area on 223.6 m^2, and average of land area on 220.2 m^2, it means on average the price of 1 m^2 area in DKI Jakarta is 13,833,314.00 idr. 

Further question that would need more data and analyzing:
1. With capital city moving in a few years and sea level rising, would it make housing prices cheaper?
2. Is there spesific area in Jakarta that has cheaper or more expensive prices and why?
3. What is the average income of DKI Jakarta's population and how long would it take for them to buy the house with the average pricing?
